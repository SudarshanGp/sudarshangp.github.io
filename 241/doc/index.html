		<h1> Parallel Make </h1>
		<p>
		More and more programs today are being programmed as multithreaded applications. The goal of this MP is to give you more practice writing multithreaded applications and to expose common pitfalls that occur while designing a program to work in a parallel manner. Additionally, you will need to make use of synchronization primitives to protect memory shared amongst the threads. 
		</p>
		<p>
		You are tasked with writing an application which will imitate the common <code>make</code> utility. Make is a utility that automatically builds executable programs from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. You have encounted Makefiles in CS 241 MPs as well as in your previous undergraduate CS classes and should be familiar with it. 
		</p>
		<p>
		We have provided a parse function which will list dependencies and commands to run for different target values. You will need to use this parse function to keep track of the work that needs to be done. Then using a fixed pool of threads, you will make sure that all commands are executed after their dependencies. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Before starting you should read the Wikipedia article on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a>.
		</p>
		<div class="demo-crumbs mdl-color-text--red-500" >
		  <h6> THIS IS A HARD MP. IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU START EARLY.</h6>
		</div>
		<h3> Tasks </h3>
		<h4> Task 1 </h4>
		<p>
		The first thing you will need to do is to parse the given command-line options. All handling of options should be done using <code> getopt() </code>. This function will allow you to specify which options are valid and which require arguments. The usage for parmake looks like:
		</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
			<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
	parmake [ -f makefile ] [ -j threads ] [ targets ]

			</code>
		</pre>
<!-- 		<p>
			If a makefile is not specified, <code>./makefile</code> or <code>./Makefile</code> should be used in that order, if they exist (see <code>access()</code>). Return a non-zero value if neither of these files exist. If the number of worker threads -j is not specified, the default value of 1 should be used. The j worker threads are in addition to the one main thread. The space separated list of targets will always come last and is optional. You will need to save any targets given for use in Part 2. The man page for getopt() shows an example of how to locate the position of targets within argc.
		</p> -->
		<ul>
			<li> If a makefile is not specified, <code>./makefile</code> or <code>./Makefile</code> should be used in that order, if they exist (see <code>access()</code>).
			<li> Return a non-zero value if neither of these files exist. If the number of worker threads -j is not specified, the default value of 1 should be used. The j worker threads are in addition to the one main thread.
			<li> The list of command line args will always come last and is optional.
			<li> You will need to save any targets given for use in Part 2. 
			<li> The man page for <code>getopt()</code> shows an example of how to locate the position of targets within argc.
		</ul>
		<h4> Task 2 </h4>
		<p>
		Next, the main thread should parse the makefile. The makefile will always consist of one or more rules of the form:
		</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
		<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
	target [target ...]: [dependency ...]
	    [command 1]
	    .
	    .
	    [command n]
    	</code>
		</pre>

		<p>For example:</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
		<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
	rule1: rule2 rule3
	    commandtoberun withargs
	    commandtoberun2 withargs
	rule2:
	    othercommand 
	rule3 rule4:
	    finalcommand 
    	</code>
		</pre>
		<p>
		If you are unfamiliar with the syntax do not be afraid. We have provided you with a parsing function, <code>parser_parse_makefile()</code>.
		</p>
		<p>
		When invoking the parser you will have to provide "call-back" functions and the list of targets from Part 1. This means you will have to pass function pointers of the type defined in parser.h. These callback functions will be called from <code>parser_parse_makefile()</code> providing you with the parsed strings. For dependencies and commands, the target to which the dependency or command belongs is also passed back.
		</p>
		<p>
		The list of targets should be a NULL-terminated array of strings similar to that of argv. The targets are used by the parser to select the correct rules (for example '<code>make clean</code>' only runs the clean target). If no targets are given on the command line, the list of targets will only include the terminating NULL pointer. Those curious of the implementation can view the source in parser.c although this is not necessary for a functioning MP.
		</p>
		<p>
		We have provided an implementation of a queue for you to store rules. It can be viewed in <code>queue.h</code>.
		</p>

		<h4> Task 3 </h4>
		<p>
			Once all the rules have been parsed, we will need to make two decisions for each rule: When and how we satisfy the rule. We determine what to do for these cases by the rule's dependencies.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before we satisfy a rule, we must examine its dependencies. Each rule depends on a set of other rules and files. It is important to note that each dependency is either the name of another rule or the the name of a file on disk or BOTH. A rule can be run if and only if all of rules that it depends on have been satisfied.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it comes time to satisfy the rule we must first determine if we need to run the rule's commands. We run it's command if and only if at least one of the following is true:
		</p>
			<ul>
				<li> The name of the rule is not the name of a file on disk (check using <code>access()</code>).
				<li> The rule depends on another rule that is not the name of a file on disk.
				<li> The rule is the name of a file on disk, and it depends on another file with a NEWER modification time than the rule's modification time (check using <code>stat()</code>).
				<li> Once a rule's commands have been run (or we determine that they need not be run), we may mark the rule as satisfied.
			</ul>
		<p>
			For your convenience these rules are captured in the following flow chart:
		</p>	
		<div class = "centered">
			<img src="flowchart.png" alt="Flow Chart" style="width:423px;height:1026px;" >
		</div>
		<h4> Task 4 </h4>
		<p>
			The number of threads running rules is given as the command-line option -j. Each worker thread will be in charge of processing rules. This consists of determining whether its dependencies have been fulfilled and then executing any associated commands. There are several important concurrency requirements:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>You should NOT make any rule unless its dependencies have been met (all dependent rules have been run, see the previous section)
			<li> If there exists J rules with all dependencies met and T threads where J>=T, NO threads should be sleeping
			<li> If there exists J rules with all dependencies met and T threads where  J&ltT, T-J threads should be sleeping
		</ul>
		<p>
		...that is, every thread should be as busy as possible processing rules if there is work to be done.
		</p>
		<h3> Notes </h3>
		<ul>
			<li> Only make changes in <code>parmake.c</code>
			<li> You can assume all makefiles will be in valid Makefile style syntax as described previously as well as have no circular dependencies.
			<li> Reordering rules that may be run at the same time to achieve global optimal efficiency is not required. The dependency graph might have natural choke points where one task limits all the others.
			<li> You will receive 0 points if your implementation uses <code>sleep()</code> or busy waiting.
			<li> You must only ever launch T threads. Do not keep re-spawning new threads for every rule.
		</ul>
		<h3> Test Files </h3>
		<p>
		We have provided six test files for you. You can find the expected output by running them with GNU "make", which follows the same rules as your program. If you choose not to <code>printf()</code> the commands you are going to run, your output will match <code>make -s</code>.
		</p>
		<h3> Compiling and Running </h3>
		<p>
		To compile, run the following commands from a command prompt on a Linux machine:
		</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
		<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
    %> make clean 
    %> make
	    </code>
		</pre>
		<p>
		To run the executable,
		</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
		<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
    %> ./parmake [ -f makefile ] [ -j threads] [ targets ]
	    </code>
		</pre>
		<p>
		For example:
		</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
		<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
    %> ./parmake -f testfile4 -j 2
	    </code>
		</pre>
	<p>
	This should generate the same output as:
	</p>
		<pre class="big-code-block">
		<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">
    %> make -f testfile4 -j 2
     === OR ===
    %> make -s -f testfile4 -j 2
	    </code>
		</pre>
