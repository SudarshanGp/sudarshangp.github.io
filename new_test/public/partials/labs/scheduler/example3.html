  <h1>Example 3</h1>

  <p>Consider the following simple schedule:</p>

  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>job number</th>

      <th>arrival time</th>

      <th>running time</th>

      <th>priority</th>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>0</td>

      <td>0</td>

      <td>8</td>

      <td>1</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>1</td>

      <td>1</td>

      <td>8</td>

      <td>1</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
      <td>2</td>

      <td>3</td>

      <td>4</td>

      <td>2</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The flow of execution of functions calls is as follows:</p>

  <blockquote>
    scheduler_start_up(cores = 1, scheme = RR)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; scheduler initialized<br>
    <br>
    new_job(job_number = 0, time = 0, running_time = 8, priority =
    1)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns 0, indicating job(id=0) should run
    on core(id=0)<br>
    <br>
    new_job(job_number = 1, time = 1, running_time = 8, priority =
    1)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns -1, indicating that job(id=1) will
    not be scheduled at this time.<br>
    <br>
    quantum_expired(core_id = 0, time = 2)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns 1, indicating job(id=1) should run
    next on core(id=0).<br>
    <br>
    new_job(job_number = 2, time = 3, running_time = 4, priority =
    2)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns -1, indicating that job(id=2) will
    not be scheduled at this time.<br>
    <br>
    quantum_expired(core_id = 0, time = 4)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns 0, indicating job(id=0) should run
    next on core(id=0).<br>
    <br>
    quantum_expired(core_id = 0, time = 6)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns 2, indicating job(id=2) should run
    next on core(id=0).<br>
    <br>
    quantum_expired(core_id = 0, time = 8)<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; --&gt; returns 1, indicating job(id=1) should run
    next on core(id=0).<br>
    <br>
    ... /* jobs will continue rotating and running until all jobs
    finish, statistics, and then cleanup */
  </blockquote>

  <p>...it's important to note that even though the jobs arrive in
  the order <tt>0 1 2</tt>, the order of the jobs in your priority
  queue will following the rotation: <tt>0 2 1</tt> -&gt; <tt>2 1
  0</tt> -&gt; <tt>1 0 2</tt> -&gt; <tt>0 2 1</tt>.</p>

  <p>When the simulator is executed and the flow of execution is
  implemented correctly, you will see the following output:</p>
