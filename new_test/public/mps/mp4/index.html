<h1> Password Cracker MP </h1>

<h3> I forgot my password! </h3>
<p>
As the head system administrator at UI-Forgetful, 90% of your work
is spent dealing with &quot;I forgot my password&quot; emails.
Nobody wants to learn a new password, so rather than resetting your
user's passwords, you decided to help them out by figuring
out what their old passwords were.
</p>

<!--
Speaking of password cracking accelerated by knowing the password prefix...
Richard Feynmann liked to tell the story of how he cracked into safes
containing the most dangerous information in the world while he was at
Los Alamos Laboratory working on the development of the atomic
bomb. ("Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman!", Richard P. Feynman) He
would visit other researchers' offices when their safes were open and
surreptitiously jiggle the handle of their safes to determine the
first couple numbers of the combination. His underhanded hobby became
quite useful when papers were needed from safes belonging to
researchers who happened to be out of town at the time.
-->


<p>
The Linux machines you manage don't store
the passwords in plain text. They're stored as a <b>hash</b> of the password.
(If you're curious, take a look at the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file.
You'll need root permissions.)
</p>

<p>
A hash is a one-way operation. Given the hash of a user's password, there is
no easy way to recover the password. However, if you're willing to burn
some CPU time, you can do a brute-force attack: try every possible password
until you find one that hashes to the same string.
</p>

<p>
To hash a password, use the <code>crypt_r()</code> function.
<code>crypt_r()</code> will hash the given string and store the
results in a <code>struct crypt_data</code> buffer that you pass to
it. <b>Note:</b> the first time you use a <code>struct
crypt_data</code> buffer with
<code>crypt_r()</code>, it is important to mark the buffer as uninitialized
by setting the data member <code>"initialized"</code> to 0.
For example:
</p>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">struct crypt_data cdata;
cdata.initialized = 0;

const char *hashed = crypt_r("example1", "xx", &cdata);
printf("hash of 'example1' = %s\n", hashed);

hashed = crypt_r("example2", "xx", &cdata);
printf("hash of 'example2' = %s\n", hashed);
</code>
</pre>


This code will print:
<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">hash of 'example1' = xxPXiOTQGgNxc
hash of 'example2' = xx96r6/l1aOi.
</code>
</pre>

<p>The string returned by <code>crypt_r()</code> is stored inside the
<code>struct crypt_data</code> structure, and does not need to be
deallocated.</p>

<p><em>What is the &quot;xx&quot; argument? </em>  It's called the
  <b>salt</b>. It 'flavors' the hash so that even if you hash the same
  string, if the salt is different the hash result will be different.
  This is done to prevent users with the same password from having
  identical password hashes.  Fun story: one of your TA's worked at a
  well-known internet company, and for a while that company was not
  setting a salt value when hashing customer passwords. With a quick
  scan of the customer database, it was apparent that the most common
  password used by customers was the name of the company.
</p>

<p>
  For this assignment, don't create a unique salt - just use "xx" for
  the value of the salt argument in every call to crypt_r().
</p>


<h3> I remember part of it... </h3>

<p>It would take a long time to try every possible password, so when
a user tells you they forgot their password, you always ask them,
&quot;How much of the password do you remember?&quot;</p>

Your users are very consistent. They always remember:
<ul>
<li> The first few letters in their password
<li> The total length of the password.
</ul>
<p>For example, a user might say, &quot;It starts with 'hello', and it's a
total of 8 letters.&quot;
</p>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">hello...
12345678
</code>
</pre>

<p>Users are also terribly uncreative at UI-Forgetful, and their passwords
<b>contain only lowercase letters</b>.

<p>That's a good head start. You only need to find 3 missing letters.
That's just 26^3, or 17,576 combinations to test.</p>

<p>You look up their hashed password in the <code>/etc/shadow</code> file,
and find that their hashed password is <code>&quot;xxsczBXm6z4zA&quot;</code>.
All you need to do is try every possible set of letters in the missing
characters in their password. For example: </p>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">known: hello...

target hash: xxsczBXm6z4zA

<b>Password     Hash</b>
helloaaa     xxtDXGaGbU2Mw
helloaab     xxm/e8KoZoEK.
helloaac     xxC4UjY9eNri6
...
helloyot     xxnzydPlL.SKE
helloyou     xxsczBXm6z4zA
</code>
</pre>

<p>Aha, success!  The hash of &quot;helloyou&quot; is &quot;xxsczBXm6z4zA&quot;,
so their password is &quot;helloyou&quot;!</p>

<h3> Putting it into production </h3>

<p>Since you get so many requests to recover passwords, you decide to
make a tool to crack them. Each day, you create a file containing all
the passwords that need cracking. Just before you leave work, you start
your program working on the file.</p>

<h4> Input </h4>
<p>Each line of the file contains:</p>
<ol>
<li> Username (1-8 characters)
<li> Hashed password (13 characters)
<li> Known part of password plus periods representing the unknown
     characters (1-8 characters, contains 0-8 lowercase letters followed
     by 0-8 periods)
</ol>

<p>These three fields are separated by a single space. For example:</p>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">alice xxQSTJ2Ww.ywY sys....
bob xxt1Aco6oM3Mg ui....
charlie xxgCpPNrdWRYs big.....
</code>
</pre>

<p>If an input line is not in this format, the behavior of your program
is undefined.
<em>Although if an invalid input line is encountered, it would be nice
to output a helpful error message to stderr and ignore the line.</em> Please note that,
since the behavior is undefined, we will not grade you with invalid inputs.
</p>

<p>When multiple lines are provided, treat every line as an independent password
cracker task. For example, if you receive the input:</p>
<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">alice xxQSTJ2Ww.ywY sys....
alice xxQSTJ2Ww.ywY sys....
alice xxQSTJ2Ww.ywY sys....
</code>
</pre>

<p>The password for the user alice should be cracked 3 times, not cracked once
and saved somewhere. In other words, don't worry about duplicate users,
duplicate password hashes, or duplicate password prefixes in the input file</p>

<h3> Trying every possibility </h3>

<p>How can you iterate through every possible password with a given
prefix?  It's very similar to the process of counting up with
integers. Start by incrementing the least significant digit. When it
hits the maximum digit value, the next increment will reduce it to zero and
increment the next more significant digit.  For example:</p>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">1000 + 1 = 1001   (increment the 10^0 digit)
1001 + 1 = 1002   (increment the 10^0 digit)
1009 + 1 = 1010   (increment the 10^1 digit, reset the 10^0 digit)
1010 + 1 = 1011   (increment the 10^0 digit)
1999 + 1 = 2000   (increment the 10^3 digit, reset the 10^2, 10^1, and 10^0 digits)
</code></pre>

<p>To save you some time, we've provided a function for you that implements
this. See the <code style="code-block">incrementString()</code> function in <code style="code-block">common.c</code>.

<h3> Version 0: Single Threaded </h3>

<p>You've been given a single-threaded version of the password cracker,
<code style="code-block">cracker0.c</code>. It reads lines in the format described above
from standard input and attempts to crack each of the passwords.
</p>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">./cracker0 < cracker0.in
</code>
</pre>


<b>Sample input file</b>

<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">donna xxC4UjY9eNri6 hello...
eric xxqJ7cKzV3v4E zip.....

</code></pre>

<b>Expected output</b> (the timing values may vary, but everything else
should match exactly)
<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">Password for donna is helloaac (3 hashes in 0.00 seconds)
Password for eric is zipaaazz (676 hashes in 0.00 seconds)

Total time: 5.07 seconds.
</code></pre>

<h3> Version 1: Thread pool (Due at the end of week 1, 50% of final grade) </h3>

<p> Use multiple threads to speed up the password processing.  The
main thread will <b>start up a pool of worker threads, then read lines
of input from standard input</b>. Each line will be turned into a task
that is added to a task queue. The worker threads will pull one task
at a time from the task queue and process the task. When a worker
thread starts processing a task, it will print the username of the
task.</p>

<p>When a worker thread finishes a task, print the same output as in
Version 0, but prefix each line with the index of the thread, where the
first worker thread is index 1.  The time the thread reports should be
the amount of CPU time the thread spent cracking that password, not
wall clock time.  Use <code>getThreadCPUTime()</code>, declared in
<code>common.h</code>.
</p>

<p>
When the main thread reaches the end of the input stream (EOF, which you can
send manually with CTRL-D), it will add a special "poison pill" task to the task
queue.  When a thread receives that task, it will put the task back on the queue
(so other threads will see it), and then exit.  It doesn't matter how you
designate a task as the poison pill. <b>Make sure you don't exit until an EOF is
read! The worker threads should all keep running, waiting for an input, until
the EOF is read.</b>
</p>

<p>After all the worker threads have exited, the main thread will
print:</p>
<ul>
<li> Number of successful and unsuccessful password cracks
<li> Wall clock time since the program was started (via <code>getTime()</code>
     in <code>common.h</code>)
<li> CPU time used (a sum of the CPU time used in all threads).
<li> Proportion of CPU time to wall clock time.
</ul>

<p>Be sure to use thread-safe synchronization any time a thread accesses
a variable that is modified by another thread.</p>

<p><b> This is a good time to check that you're using <code>crypt_r()</code>,
not <code>crypt()</code>. </b>  <em>Why is this important?</em></p>

<p>Put your code for version 1 in "cracker1.c".  Its executable will
be "cracker1". Put any code you want to share with the other versions in
"common.h" or "common.c", as appropriate. Hint: You may want to use
your queue from lab! (stick that code in common.c and common.h)</p>

<p>To help you with edge cases, we've provided a compiled solution for part1,
named <code>cracker1_reference</code></p>

<p><b>Files used for grading</b></p>
<ul>
    <li> <code>common.c</code> </li>
    <li> <code>common.h</code> </li>
    <li> <code>cracker1.c</code> </li>
</ul>

<p>By default, create 4 worker threads. If a command line argument is supplied
to the program, use that as the number of worker threads rather than the
default. If the command line argument is not a positive
integer or there are more than one arguments, print a helpful error
message and exit.</p>

<h3> Version 2: Parallelize each task (Due at the end of week 2, 50% of final grade) </h3>

<p>While reading through your personal emails, the NSA learned about
your password cracker and decided it was threat to national security.
So they hired you away from UI-Forgetful with threats of imprisonment
and a large salary increase.</p>

<p>Your first task at your new job is to crack larger passwords faster.
Version 1 works great when there is a long list of passwords that
need cracking in parallel, but it's no faster than version 0 when
there's one really hard password that needs cracking.</p>

<p>For version 2, you'll have a pool of threads, but rather than
assigning one thread to each password task, all the threads will work
in parallel on each password task.</p>

<p><em>Note: if you try this input with cracker1 it will take a long time,
because the password for jesse won't be found until iteration 78174626.

just 945682 iterations from the solution.</em></p>

<p>Distribute the work by splitting the the search space into equal-sized
chunks, one for each worker thread.  For example, if there are 3
unknown characters, then there are 26^3 = 17576 possible passwords
that need to be tested.  With 4 worker threads, you would split the
work up like this:
<tt><ul>
<li> Thread 1: 0..4393 (aaa..gmz)
<li> Thread 2: 4394..8787 (gna..mzz)
<li> Thread 3: 8788..13181 (naa..tmz)
<li> Thread 4: 13182..17575 (tna..zzz)
</ul></tt>

<p>When the number of threads doesn't divide the search space evenly,
it's easy to get off-by-one errors due to integer rounding.  To help
you out and to make sure everyone is doing it consistently, here's
code you should use for it:</p>

<pre class="big-code-block"><code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">/* Compute the subrange that a thread should work on.
     unknown_letter_count - The number of letters in the password that
       are not known.
     thread_count - The number of worker threads.
     thread_id - My thread ID, where the IDs start at 1.
     start_index - (output parameter) This will be set to the index of
       the first possible password this thread should try.
     count - (output parameter) This will be set to the number of
       passwords this thread should try.
*/
void getSubrange(int unknown_letter_count, int thread_count, int thread_id,
                 long *start_index, long *count) {
  int i;
  long max = 1, end_index;
  for (i=0; i < unknown_letter_count; i++) max *= 26;
  *start_index = max * (thread_id - 1) / thread_count;
  end_index = max * thread_id / thread_count;
  if (end_index > max)
    end_index = max;
  *count = end_index - *start_index;
}</code></pre>

<p><b>setStringPosition().</b> How do you find the string for a given
starting point? <code>incrementString()</code> lets you iterate
through the search space, so you could just use that.  To get to
position N, start with the unknown substring full of 'a' characters
and call <code>incrementString()</code> on it N times.  That may be
slow for large values of N, so we included the
function <code>setStringPosition()</code> (declared in common.h and
defined in common.c) that does it more efficiently.</p>

<p>With all the threads working on the same task, you may want to
restructure your thread synchronization a little.  Rather than a
queue, you may wish to use a <a href="https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki/Synchronization,-Part-6:-Implementing-a-barrier">barrier</a>.
</p>

<pre class="big-code-block" style="font-size:.7em"><code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">                Startup     Task 0..............................   Task 1..............................

(Zoom out if the above text line wraps)
<p>Like with version 1, you may not create new threads for each task.
The threads you create at the beginning of the program must be the
same threads that compute the last task.</p>

<p>When the main thread reads a task, it should
print <tt>"Start &lt;username&gt;"</tt>.  When a thread starts processing
a task, it should print its index and starting position. For example:</p>

<p>When a worker thread finds the correct password, it should tell all
the other threads to stop working on the task.  You can implement this
with a simple flag variable that each thread checks on each iteration.
Since all the threads are reading this variable and any thread may write
to it, you'll need to properly synchronize access to it.</p>

<p>When the worker threads finish a task, each thread will print the
number of passwords it tried and a word describing how its run
finished:</p>
<ul>
<li> <b><tt>(found)</tt></b> - this thread found the password
<li> <b><tt>(cancelled)</tt></b> - stopped early because another thread found the password
<li> <b><tt>(end)</tt></b> - finished with no password found.  Note: this can happen if the password was found, but this thread finished its chunk before
another thread found the password.
</ul>
<p> After all worker threads finish each task, the main thread will
print the password (if found), the total number of hashes, the wall
clock and CPU time spent on that task, and the ratio of CPU time to
wall clock time.</p>

<h4> Thread status hook </h4>
<p>We've provided a simple tool to help you when debugging your
program.  See <code>thread_status.h</code>
and <code>thread_status.c</code>.  If you
install <code>threadStatusPrint()</code> as a handler for
<code>SIGINT</code>, it will print a brief summary of what each
thread is currently doing any time you hit <code>ctrl-c</code>. For
example:</p>
<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">% ./cracker2 cracker2.in 2 100000 2
Start u0000000
Start u0000001
^C
** Thread 0: semaphore wait at cracker2.c:219
** Thread 1: processing at cracker2.c:269
** Thread 2: processing at cracker2.c:269
</code>
</pre>
<p>To use it:</p>
<ol>
<li> <tt>#include "thread_status.h"</tt>
<li> Install <code>threadStatusPrint()</code> as the signal handler
     for SIGINT.
<li> Call <code>threadStatusSet()</code> to describe what the thread is
  currently doing.  The argument to <code>threadStatusSet()</code>
  should be a string constant. For example:
<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">threadStatusSet("initializing");
...
while (!done) {
  threadStatusSet("waiting for task");
  task = queue_pull(task_queue);
  threadStatusSet("processing");
  ...
}
</code>
</pre>
</ol>
<p>When <code>threadStatusPrint()</code> is called, it doesn't print the exact
line number that each thread is at. It just prints the line number of the most
recent call to <tt>threadStatusSet()</tt>. So, for more precise reporting, add more
calls to <tt>threadStatusSet()</tt> to your code.</p>

<p><code>thread_status.h</code> contains macros that will redefine calls
to common thread synchronization functions so that when a thread is blocking
on one of them, its status will represent that (like the &quot;semaphore wait&quot;
on line 219 in the example above).</p>

<p>You're not required to use the thread status tool as part of the
assignment, we just thought it might make your debuggining easier.</p>

<h4> create_examples </h4>
<p>
    We've also provided a small program to create example input files, to help you with your testing.
    To build the create_examples program, run <code>make create_examples</code>. To use the program,
    write it's output to a file, then use the file as input to a cracker program. For example:
</p>
<pre class="big-code-block">
<code class="code-block" style="white-space: pre !important">./create_examples 10 100 150 > my_examples.in
./cracker1 < my_examples.in
</code>
</pre>

<p>To see what the cracked passwords should be, use the <code>-soln</code> flag when running <code>create_examples</code> (see the usage documentation given when running the program with no arguments).</p>
