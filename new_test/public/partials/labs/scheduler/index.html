  <h1>Due: 2015 Dec 2, 2359</h1>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>You're not working at a start up. You're just a kid.</p>

  <p>Doing a mandatory assignment for CS241.</p>

  <p>There's no CEO, no manager, no mentor.</p>

  <p>You're writing a scheduler. Rather than interacting directly
  with the operating system, we have provided for you a simulator:
  we will simulate quantized and discrete time, jobs arriving, and
  jobs running. Your library will inform the scheduler which job
  should run next.</p>

  <p>You will find several files:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Programming files:

      <ul>
        <li><tt>simulator.c</tt>: <b>You should not edit this
        file.</b> This file is the discrete event simulator that,
        when run, will interact with your library. You can find
        more information on how to run this at the end of this web
        page. This file will be replaced by the autograder, so any
        changes you make will be ignored.</li>

        <s><li><tt>libpriqueue/libpriqueue.c</tt> and
        <tt>libpriqueue/libpriqueue.h</tt>: Files related to the
        priority queue. You will need to edit both of the files.
        You can feel free to add any helper functions, but you must
        implement all the functions where we provide outlines. We
        have outlined a minimal amount of functions that you should
        implement, and we will grade those. However, you have the
        flexibility to implement whatever kind of priority queue
        you like, whether it is a array based heap implementation,
        a linked list based implementation or somethine else.</li></s>

        <s><li><tt>queuetest.c</tt>: A small test case to test your
        priority queue, independent of the simulator. You may want
        to create more complex test cases in this file. The file is
        not used by the autograder.</li></s>

        <li><tt>libscheduler/libscheduler.c</tt> and
        <tt>libscheduler/libscheduler.h</tt>: Files related to the
        scheduler. You may need to edit both of the files. You can
        feel free to add any helper functions, but you must
        implement all the functions where we provide outlines.</li>

        <li><tt>examples.pl</tt>: A perl script of <tt>diff</tt>
        runs that tests your program against the 54 test output
        files. This file will output differences between your
        program and the examples.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

	<li>Files you need to edit and commit:
		<ul><li><s><tt>libscheduler/libpriqueue.h</tt></s> (we felt bad for you)</li>
			<li><s><tt>libscheduler/libpriqueue.c</tt></s> (serious mercy)</li>
			<li><tt>libscheduler/libscheduler.h</tt></li>
			<li><tt>libscheduler/libscheduler.c</tt></li>
		</ul>
	</li>

    <li>Example input files:

      <ul>
        <li><tt>examples/proc1.csv</tt></li>

        <li><tt>examples/proc2.csv</tt></li>

        <li><tt>examples/proc3.csv</tt></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

  <h2>[Part 1]: Priority Queue</h2>

  <s><p>To build a scheduler, a fundamental data structure is a
  priority queue. The first part of this lab requires you to
  complete <tt>libpriqueue</tt>, a priority queue library. You will
  be using this library in your scheduler.</p></s>

  <h3>libpriqueue API</h3>

  <s><p>To complete <tt>libpriqueue</tt>, you must implement the
  functions outlined in <tt>libpriqueue.c</tt>. Full function
  descriptions are provided for each function. <b>In every
  function</b>, you may assume that all pointers given will be
  valid, non-<tt>NULL</tt> pointers.</p></s>

  <h2>[Part 2]: Scheduler</h2>

  <p>You will need to implement a multi-core scheduler in a
  simulated computer. You will be provided with a set of cores to
  schedule a set of tasks on, much like a real Linux scheduler.</p>

  <p><b>You should use your priority queue <s>you just built</s> to help
  you complete this part of the lab.</b></p>

  <p>To complete this lab, you must implement the eight functions
  defined in <tt>libscheduler/libscheduler.c</tt>. These functions
  are self-descriptive, but a full function outline is provided for
  you for each function in the SVN files. These function will be utilized by <tt>simulator.c</tt>.</p>

  <h2>Scheduler Details</h2>

  <p>The simulator will always follow a few, very specific rules.
  It's not important to understand the specifics of the simulator,
  but we provide these to help you with debugging:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All execution of tasks will happen <b>at the very end of a
    time unit</b>.</li>

    <li>The events in a time unit will occur in this order:

      <ol>
        <li>If a job's last unit of execution occurred in the
        previous time unit, a <tt>scheduler_job_finished()</tt>
        call will be made as the first call in the new time
        unit.</li>

        <li><i>If a job has finished, the quantum timer for the
        core will be reset. (Therefore,
        <tt>scheduler_quantum_expired()</tt> will never be called
        on a specific core at the same unit that a job has
        finished, no matter what scheme)</i></li>

        <li>In <tt>RR</tt>, if the quantum timer has expired, a
        <tt>scheduler_quantum_expired()</tt> will be called. Please
        notice that if the job finished at the same time unit its
        quantum expired, this function will NOT be called. This is
        because its quantum is reset when the job finishes, and
        scheduler_job_finished() is always called in the first
        place.</li>

        <li>If any job arrives at the time unit, the
        <tt>scheduler_new_job()</tt> function will be called.</li>

        <li>Finally, the CPU will execute the active jobs on each
        core.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>There are a few specific cases where a scheduler needs to
  define behavior based on the scheduling policy provided. In this
  lab, you should apply the following rules:

  <ul>
    <li>When multiple cores are available(have no job running) to
    take on a job, the core with the lowest id should take the
    job.</li>

    <li>A job cannot be run on multiple cores in the same time
    unit. However, a job may start on one core, get preempted, and
    continue on a different core.</li>

    <li>In <tt>PSJF</tt>, if the job has been partially executed,
    schedule the job based on its <b>remaining time</b> (not the
    full running time).</li>

    <li>In <tt>RR</tt>, when a new job arrives, it must be placed
    at the end of the cycle of jobs. Every existing job must run
    some amount of time before the new job should run.</li>

    <li>In all schemes except <tt>RR</tt>, if two or more jobs are
    tied (e.g., if in <tt>PRI</tt> multiple jobs have the priority of
    <tt>1</tt>), use the job with the <b>earliest arrival time</b>.
    In <tt>scheduler_new_job()</tt>, we provided the assumption that all jobs
    will have a unique arrival time. In <tt>RR</tt>, when a job is
    unscheduled as a result of the quantum timer expiring, it must
    always be placed at the end of the queue.</li>

    <li>In all non-preemptive schemes, a new job can never swap out
    any job that has already been put into the core. Consider a
    schedule running <tt>PRI</tt> on a single core. After some
    amount of time:

      <ul>
        <li>A job finished in the last time unit, resulting in a
        <tt>scheduler_job_finished()</tt> call to be made to your
        scheduler. The scheduler returns that job(id=4) should run.
        job(id=4) has priority 3.</li>

        <li>In this time unit, a new job(id=5, priority 1) also
        arrived. This results in a <tt>scheduler_new_job()</tt>
        call to be made to your scheduler. Even though the new
        job(id=5) has greater priority(priority 1), it will NOT
        swap out job(id=4), which was already scheduled by
        <tt>scheduler_job_finished()</tt>. Now, job(id=4) is
        scheduled to run.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>In all preemptive schemes, a new job needs to preempt the
    job that is 'worst'. Consider a schedule running <tt>PPRI</tt>
    on 2 cores. After some amount of time:

      <ul>
        <li>Core 1: job finished in the last time unit. Core 2:
        Job(id=3, priority 2, 5 seconds remaining)</li>

        <li>The job in core 1 finished in the last time unit,
        resulting in a <tt>scheduler_job_finished()</tt> call to be
        made to your scheduler. The scheduler returns that
        job(id=4) should run on core 1. job(id=4) has priority
        3.</li>

        <li>In this time unit, a new job(id=5, priority 1) also
        arrived. This results in a <tt>scheduler_new_job()</tt>
        call to be made to your scheduler. Since the new job has
        greater priority than the worst job in 2 cores, it will
        preempt that worst job(id=4), which was scheduled by
        <tt>scheduler_job_finished()</tt>. Now job(id=5) and
        job(id=3) are scheduled to run.</li>

        <li>Only after all jobs finished and any new job arrives
        will the CPU execute the task. In this example, job(id=4)
        was never run on the CPU when it was scheduled by
        <tt>scheduler_job_finished()</tt>. <b>When calculating
        response time, you should not consider job as responded
        until it runs a CPU cycle.</b></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Compile and Run</h2>To compile this lab, run:

  <blockquote>
    make clean<br>
    make
  </blockquote><s>To run the helper tester program for part1, run:

  <blockquote>
    ./queuetest
  </blockquote></s>To run the simulator, run:

  <blockquote>
    ./simulator -c &lt;cores&gt; -s &lt;scheme&gt; &lt;input
    file&gt;
  </blockquote>For example:

  <blockquote>
    ./simulator -c 2 -s fcfs examples/proc1.csv
  </blockquote>The acceptable values for <tt>scheme</tt> (outlined
  above) are:

  <ul>
    <li><tt>FCFS</tt></li>

    <li><tt>SJF</tt></li>

    <li><tt>PSFJ</tt></li>

    <li><tt>PRI</tt></li>

    <li><tt>PPRI</tt></li>

    <li><tt>RR#</tt>, where # indicates any numeric value</li>
  </ul>We provide three sample schedules:
  <tt>examples/proc1.csv</tt>, <tt>examples/proc2.csv</tt> and
  <tt>examples/proc3.csv</tt>. We also provide the expected output
  of those schedules in the <tt>examples</tt> directory. <b>It's
  only important that lines starting with <tt>FINAL TIMING
  DIAGRAM</tt> match.</b> We will not grade any output except the
  last few lines, as <tt>show_queue()</tt> is not required to be
  implemented in the same way as we did.<br>
  <br>
  To test your program aganist all the test cases in an automated
  way, we provide a simple perl script. To run all 54 tests, simply
  run:

  <blockquote>
    ./examples.pl
  </blockquote>All differences will be printed. Therefore, if no
  data is printed, your program has passed the test cases in the
  <tt>examples</tt> directory.

  <h1>Logistics</h1>

  <h4>DON'T EDIT THE MAKEFILE</h4>

  <p>In CS 241, every program will be compiled using <tt>make</tt>.
  When autograding your lab, we add additional files for test cases
  and use a different Makefile. Therefore, we do not use your
  Makefile to compile the code. <b>If you edit your Makefile, your
  code probably won't compile for the autograder.</b></p>

  <h4>ORGANIZATION OF FILES</h4>

  <p>This file is one of two instruction files associated with
  machine problems in CS 241. This file describes how to submit
  your lab grading details, and other details that are shared
  between all labs in CS 241. With each lab, there is a separate
  file that explains the specific details on the lab.</p>

  <h4>TESTING YOUR PROGRAM</h4>

  <p>Since all testing and grading by course staff will be done on
  the VMs, it is <b>STRONGLY ADVISED</b> that you test your program
  on your CS241 VM before submission. The fact that your program
  "runs perfectly" on your own machine will get you zero points if
  your program does not run at all on the provided CS241 VMs.</p>

  <h1>TL;DR</h1>

  <p>This lab is designed to give you experience with implementing
  job scheduling algorithms. You will be implementing the
  algorithms learned in class, specifically round robin
  (<tt>RR</tt>), shortest job first (<tt>SJF</tt>), first come
  first serve (<tt>FCFS</tt>), shortest priority first
  (<tt>SPF</tt>), pre-emptive <tt>SJF</tt>, pre-emptive
  <tt>SPF.</tt></p>

  <p><strong>Files that need to be modified:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>libpriqueue/libpriqueue.h</li>

    <li>libpriqueue/libpriqueue.c</li>

    <li>libscheduler/libscheduler.h</li>

    <li>libscheduler/libscheduler.c</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To run all 54 tests, simply run:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ./examples.pl
  </blockquote>

  <p>To run the simulator, run:</p>

  <blockquote>
    ./simulator -c &lt;cores&gt; -s &lt;scheme&gt; &lt;input
    file&gt;
  </blockquote>For example:

  <blockquote>
    ./simulator -c 2 -s fcfs examples/proc1.csv
  </blockquote>

  <p><em>Hint:</em> Examine simulator.c to understand how the
  simulator runs.</p>

  <p><strong>How simulator.c works:</strong></p>

  <p>In libscheduler.c, you'll implement a bunch of methods that
  we'll call as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>To start things off, we'll call
    <code>scheduler_start_up(...)</code> exactly once.</li>

    <li>Then, we'll run through all the time units from the
    beginning to the end.

      <ul>
        <li>If there's a jov that just ended during this time unit,
        we'll make a call to
        <code>scheduler_job_finished(...)</code>.</li>

        <li>If we're using <tt>RR</tt> and a time quantum expires
        during this time unit, we'll call
        <code>scheduler_quantum_expired(...)</code>.</li>

        <li>If there's a job that begins at this time unit, we'll
        add this job using one call to
        <code>scheduler_new_job(...)</code>. This is specified in
        the files in examples/proc1.csv, examples/proc2.csv, and
        examples/proc3.csv.</li>

        <li>Then we'll run the next time unit and repeat.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
